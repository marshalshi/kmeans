the code is very simple in order to finish several k-means algorithm.

about the initial function of kmeans, i use random, k-center and k-means++.

the file "a", "aa" and "gau" is the test file.
this code just for 2-D points.

how to use:
>python2 gui.py


(because i use the pylab in order to draw the graph, the running time of the code is very long. around(40s) but finishing clustering about 10s)
